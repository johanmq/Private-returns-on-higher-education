In this project we analysed the private and social returns on higher education in France.

The data used for the study covered a period from 2003 to 2014, from a survey of INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, national statistics bureau of France).
All the analysis was performed using R language.

The study was conducted by Johan Macq and Timoth√© Krauth in ENSAE Master 1 year.

The report is available only in French, but you will find the conclusion of our results in English in the PDF named "Main Results".
