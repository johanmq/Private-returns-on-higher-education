In this project we analysed the private and social returns on higher education in France.

The data used for the study covered a period from 2003 to 2014, from a survey of INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, national statistics bureau of France).
All the analysis was performed using R language.

The report is available only in French, but you will find a summary of our results in the PDF "Main Results".
